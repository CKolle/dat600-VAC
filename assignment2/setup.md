# Setup

On linux or macOS systems make sure you have CMake and a C compiler installed that supports C23. And make sure you have CMake version 3.5 or higher.
Look up your distribution's package manager for installation instructions.

To build the project, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

Next compile the project with make:

```bash
make
```

You should now have two executables in the build directory. One called set_test and the other called assignment2.
